```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This just reproduces figures from Karl Broman's Jax talk. 
This file is done separately because of some clash with `c()` function when attaching `qtl` or `qtlbook` packages.
Here is a list of figures:

- perm_hist_bw.jpg

```{r}
source("func.R")
source("colors_bw.R")
bropath <- "~/Documents/Talks/broman_karl/Talk_JAXsysgen"
bw <- TRUE
```

Trick to create jpeg instead of pdf:

```{r}
pdf <- function(file, width, height, onefile, ...) {
  jpeg(file = stringr::str_replace(file, ".pdf", ".jpg"), width = width * 96, height = height * 96, ...)
}
```

## Models Talk

```{r}
if(!dir.exists("Rcache")) {
  dir.create("Rcache")
}
```

The `perm_hist.R` seems to get stuck. Had to do by hand.

```{r}
source(file.path(bropath, "Intro/R", "perm_hist.R"))
```
