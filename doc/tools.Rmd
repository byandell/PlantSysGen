## Appeal of new technology

- Better, faster, smarter, â€¦?
    + but does more yield better insight?
- How to manage data volume
    + keep track of it all
    + decide what is important 
- How (or why) to use more complicated models?
    + need to develop new analysis tools
    + want to find new ways to visualize
- Be involved in process of data inquiry 
    + share with colleagues (in real time)
    + reach beyond domain boundaries

## tools & workflow: big idea

## Technology tools and platforms

- types of tools
    + algorithms: software tools
    + machines: hardware tools
- Your laptop
    + powerful for mid- to large-size projects
    + powerful communication tool
- Scaling up
    + Massive data: storage, management, access, sharing
    + Workflow steps: engine/CPU, organizing, scheduling

## Sharing with authentication

- Tools: Box, Google, GitHub
    + data, methods, ideas, results
- Research community
    + [Arabidopsis](https://www.arabidopsis.org/)
    + [Switchgrass](http://openwetware.org/wiki/Texas_Switchgrass_Collaborative)
    + [Maize](http://www.maizegenetics.net/)
- Cross-species systems
    + DNA sequence (genomics)
    + Phe-gen relationship (QTL, systems genetics)

## Technology considerations

- Your time
    + familiarity with tools
    + familiarity with data
- Comparing results
    + model selection on one dataset
    + several methods on one data set
    + multiple data sites

## Data visualization

- genotype diagnostics
- Distribution at locus
- Scatterplots with symbols (QTL, env)
- Genome scans
    + LOD profile
    + Allele scans
    + SNP scans (GWA Manhattan plots)
- multiple traits
    + over time or space (Moore)
    + networks (small, not hair balls)
    + box- or dot-plots over conditions

## Evolution of computational tools

Advances in measurement, design and analysis would be academic
without advances in computational technology. 

- faster machines -> faster throughput of more stuff
- methods translated into algorithms
    + open source: freely distrubuted, easy to study
- standalone programs
- packages in language systems (R or Python or Matlab)
- interconnectivity of algorithms and data resources

## Collaboration systems

dangers of email-based collaboration

- trading large files back and forth (slow, not secure)
- nearly impossible to keep track of versions
- minor updates require repeat sending

modern approach: use email to notify collaborators only

- [GitHub](https://github.com) to share code & ideas with version control
- Box/DropBox & Google Drive to share documents
- iPlant to improve data access & processing efficiency

## Emerging collaboration systems

modular philosophy of layers to separate

- back-end: data and compute processing layer
- middle-ware: analysis methodology layer
- front-end: human interaction and data visualization layer
    
will enable overlapping communities to

- customize local use
- share data, methods & results with other communities
- off-load data handling & compute headaches
