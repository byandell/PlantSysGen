## Appeal of new technology

- Better, faster, smarter, â€¦?
    + but does more yield better insight?
- How to manage data volume
    + keep track of it all
    + decide what is important 
- How (or why) to use more complicated models?
    + need to develop new analysis tools
    + want to find new ways to visualize
- Be involved in process of data inquiry 
    + share with colleagues (in real time)
    + reach beyond domain boundaries

## Evolution of computational tools

Advances in measurement, design and analysis would be academic
without advances in computational technology. 

- faster machines -> faster throughput of more stuff
- methods translated into algorithms
    + open source: freely distrubuted, easy to study
- standalone programs
- packages in language systems (R or Python or Matlab)
- interconnectivity of algorithms and data resources

## Collaboration systems

dangers of email-based collaboration

- trading large files back and forth (slow, not secure)
- nearly impossible to keep track of versions
- minor updates require repeat sending

modern approach: use email to notify collaborators only

- [GitHub](https://github.com) to share code & ideas with version control
- Box/DropBox & Google Drive to share documents
- iPlant to improve data access & processing efficiency

## Emerging collaboration systems

modular philosophy of layers to separate

- back-end: data and compute processing layer
- middle-ware: analysis methodology layer
- front-end: human interaction and data visualization layer
    
will enable overlapping communities to

- customize local use
- share data, methods & results with other communities
- off-load data handling & compute headaches
