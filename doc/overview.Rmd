## Overview

Systems genetics is an approach to understand the flow of biological information that underlies complex traits.

## Approach in these talks

mix of presentation style to plant-based audience

- theory
    + set the stage
    + show big picture
- applied: using R packages
    + [qtl](http://rqtl.org): basic gene mapping
    + [rrBLUP](http://potatobreeding.cals.wisc.edu/software/): genome-wide prediction & GWAS
    + [qtl2](http://kbroman.org/qtl2/): high throughput gene mapping

## Challenges of systems genetics experiments 

Simpler models yield clearer results

- compare 2 conditions 
- examine linear trend
- control for other factors

But reality may be more complicated

- masking of genetic effect (by background, etc.)
- subtle timing (when to measure)
- hard to measure key features (shape, quality)
- unknown details of processes under study

## Evolution of laboratory protocol

genetic information (genotype)

- genetic markers discovered by accident (RFLP)
- dense sets of polymorphic markers (SNP, GBS)
- whole genomes sequencing

trait information (phenotype)

- physiological (internal) & environmental (external) measurements
- molecules and images
- inexpensive, high volume assays on 100s or 1000s of plants

(individual cell technologies not covered here) 

## Genotyping

- RFLPs & other early technologies 
- SNPs & other structural variants
    + InDels, inversions, larger blocks (100s-1000s of bps)
    + huge blocks (20k+ bps)
- GBS
- RNA-Seq to genotype
- Cautions:
    + missing data
    + mistakes in reads
    + sample mixups
    + biases in technologies 
    + reference sequence vs other founders

## Evolution of statistical methods

- experimental design: how populations are created
    + two-founder experiments (backcross, intercross)
    + advanced crosses (RILs)
    + multi-parent populations (MPP)
- model selection: how phenotypes relate to genotypes
    + single marker regressions & interval mapping (QTL)
    + association mapping (including GWAS)
    + account for non-locus genetic effects
- estimation and prediction
    + genetic action (additive, dominance, epistasis)
    + marker assisted selection (MAS)
    + genomic selection

## Evolution of computational tools

Advances in measurement, design and analysis would be academic
without advances in computational technology. 

- faster machines -> faster throughput of more stuff
- methods translated into algorithms
    + open source code: freely distrubuted, easy to study
    + standalone programs
    + packages in language systems (R or Python or Matlab)
- collaboration and sharing
    + interconnectivity of algorithms and data resources
    + collaboration tools -- beyond email attachments
    + emerging collaboration systems

## Goal of system genetics studies

- predict performance of future offspring
    + genomic selection
- estimate genetic architecture of traits
    + genomic locations
    + genetic action on phenotypes

great time to become involved in modern approaches

- many challenges
- many opportunities for substantial contributions
- help unravel important problems in biological systems
