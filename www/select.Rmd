## evolution of QTL models

original ideas focused on rare & costly markers  
models & methods refined as technology advanced

- single marker regression
- QTL (quantitative trait loci)
    + single locus models: interval mapping for QTL
    + QTL model search: QTLs & epistasis
- polygenes (association mapping)
    + adjust for population structure
    + capture "missing heritability"
- **genome-wide selection**

## what is genomic selection?

use statistical modeling to predict how a plant will perform  
before it is field-tested

- genomic selection (GS)
    + marker assisted selection (MAS)
    + genome-wide selection (GS)
- other uses of word (relevent to systems genetics)
    + natural selection: survival of the fittest
    + model selection: search for QTLs
    + selection bias: overestimate of QTL effects

## why use genomic selection?

- trait is highly polygenic (genetically variable)
    + influenced by a few key genomic regions
    + high heritability (low environmental variation)
- measuring trait is costly
    + difficult or expensive process (technology)
    + measuring tool may be highly variable
    + time-consuming (plant has to grow first)
    + desire to streamline multi-year selection

## what is genomic selection?

- forms of genome-wide selection
    + marker-assisted: with phenotypes
    + marker-based: without phenotypes
    
- use markers to improve selection for complex traits
    + predict phenotype from marker genotype
    + select candidates based on best marker genotypes
    + use training set to predict test set of individuals

## old paradigm: marker prediction

- 1990s & 2000s: markers were expensive
- economic strategy:
    + first identify significant markers (QTL analysis)
    + use best markers to genotype selection candidates
- estimate marker effects by multiple regression
    + treat genetic effects as fixed and few
    + $E(y)= \mu_q, q=(q_1,q_2,q_3)$

## marker assisted selection (MAS)

## new paradigm: use "all" markers

- new paradigm with technology advances
    + improved statistical methods and software
    + cheap markers
- using only significant markers to predict trait ...
    + gives good estimates (maybe) of markers ...
    + but does not maximize accuracy
- simple but effective approach
    + treat marker effects as random
    + use all markers (away from QTL if any)

## old vs new

## mixed model approach

MAS approach $y = \mu_q + e, V(e) = \sigma^2I$

- estimate fixed QTL effects $\hat{\mu}_q$ (MLEs)
- predict phenotype using fixed effects $\hat{y}=\hat{\mu}_q$

GS approach  $y = \mu + g + e, V(g) = \sigma_g^2K$

- estimate kinship $K$ from all markers $M$ as for `poly`
- predict random effect $\hat{g}$ using BLUP
- predict phenotype $\hat{y}=\hat{g}$

## genomic prediction

- DO example
- rrBLUP fit without QTL
- correlation 0.79

## poly + QTL genomic prediction

- DO example
- rrBLUP fit with QTL
- correlation 0.74
