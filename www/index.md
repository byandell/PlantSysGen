This folder contains Brian Yandell's presentation for the January 2017 **Plant Breeding Network and Tools as a Driving Force for Better Economy Symposium** in Bangkok, Thailand. I will have a 3-hour block of time, which I will divide into 3 50-minute segments with 10-minute breaks for open discussion. osurce material to reproduce the talk can be found at <https://github.com/byandell/PlantSysGen>.
