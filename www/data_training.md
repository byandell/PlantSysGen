This document includes suggestions for data training that might be useful for Thailand moving forward. Some is specific to plant systems genetics, but much concerns the broader challegenes of big data. This will evolve over time.

## Learning to use modern data tools

A huge task with big data is organizing our work, particularly as we realize that easy-to-use spreadsheets no longer meet all our needs. One way to think about this is: how can I arrange my work so that my "future self" in 6 months or 5 years can understand what I have done and reproduce it?

- [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org)
    + clear learning goals: move from spreadsheets to R
    + 2-day workshops, online material
    + data collection, cleaning, managing, visualization, analysis
    + volunteer instructors, nominal fee + travel
- [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org)
    + advanced topics: adopt best practices
    + 2-day workshops, online material
    + how to organize more complicated workflows
- [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/)
    + learn R, Python & data science online
    + free to academic institutions
    + online material developed by domain experts
- [Professional Skills for Data Science](http://www.stat.wisc.edu/network-skills)
    
## Systems Genetics workshops

There have been a number of 1-day to 1-week workshops in recent years concerning systems genetics, bioinformatics, biostatistics and the like. Good to research carefully before attending, and to be clear on goals. Is our goal to learn the latest methods, to be exposed to the frontier, or the learn basic skills useful today?

The workshops below cater to a mix of biologists and data scientists.

- [U WA Summer Institutes](http://www.biostat.washington.edu/suminst)
    + 2.5 day workshops in Seattle, WA
    + periodic international workshops
    + statistical genetics, data science, but NO QTL
    + large focus on human genetics
- [Jackson Labs Short Courses](http://www.jax.org/courses/)
    + week long systems genetics workshop (next: 2018)
    + Gary Churchill, Karl Broman, Brian Yandell, other experts
    + focus on mouse systems genetics, but students from many areas
    + plans to move material online
    
## Organize locally

- have a data plan for university and each project
    + see plans developed elsewhere ...
    + important for funding agencies
- create "data clubs" where colleagues share ideas & tools
    + use Data Carpentry or other resources
    + informal, open, sharing
    + focus on specific tasks & goals rather than generic concepts
- use freely available tools for organizing data
    + think about enterprise needs for confidentiality, sharing, etc.
    + Google Drive, Box or DropBox
    + GitHub repositories for source material
